Source code of my A-level CS project, keeping it here to remark the start of my career
It is a website used to randomly generate mathematical questions according to preset template, and users can do those randomly generated questions online. This app can also alternat the exam content based on user's current performance.
However, the actual product is crude and useless, it can't even be deployed outside the test enviroment. I'm keeping it here to mark my first functioning CS project, also remind me of how to use python flask.
